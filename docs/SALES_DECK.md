# SCBE-AETHERMOORE Sales Overview

## The Problem

### The Quantum Threat is Real
- **2030**: Experts predict cryptographically relevant quantum computers
- **Harvest Now, Decrypt Later**: Adversaries collecting encrypted data today
- **$3.8 trillion**: Estimated cost of cryptographic migration

### AI Safety is Critical
- **Jailbreaks**: 73% of AI systems vulnerable to prompt injection
- **Governance**: No standardized framework for AI decision auditing
- **Compliance**: Regulators demanding explainable AI

---

## The Solution: SCBE-AETHERMOORE

### Post-Quantum + AI Safety + Human Readable

**One platform that solves three critical problems:**

1. **Quantum-Safe Cryptography**
   - ML-KEM-768 (Kyber) for key encapsulation
   - ML-DSA-65 (Dilithium) for digital signatures
   - 128+ bit post-quantum security

2. **AI Governance**
   - 14-layer hyperbolic geometry pipeline
   - Deterministic ALLOW/QUARANTINE/DENY/SNAP decisions
   - Byzantine fault-tolerant swarm consensus

3. **Human-Readable Security**
   - 6 Sacred Tongue cryptolinguistic encodings
   - Encrypted data you can actually read
   - AI-to-AI communication protocol

## Sales Motion

### Discovery Questions
1. "What's your timeline for post-quantum migration?"
2. "How are you currently auditing AI decisions?"
3. "What compliance frameworks are you targeting?"
4. "Have you experienced any AI safety incidents?"

### Demo Flow
1. **Hook** (2 min): Show Sacred Tongue encoding - "encrypted data you can read"
2. **Problem** (3 min): Quantum threat, AI jailbreaks
3. **Solution** (10 min): Live demo of 14-layer pipeline
4. **Proof** (5 min): Compliance dashboard, benchmarks
5. **Close** (5 min): Trial offer, next steps

### Objection Handling

**"We're not worried about quantum yet"**
> "Harvest now, decrypt later attacks are happening today. Data encrypted with RSA in 2024 could be decrypted by 2030. When do you need to start protecting long-lived secrets?"

**"We already have an AI governance solution"**
> "How does it handle adversarial prompts? Our testing shows 80%+ block rate on jailbreak attempts with cryptographic audit trails."

**"The pricing seems high"**
> "Compare to the cost of a compliance failure or quantum breach. Our Business tier is less than 1 senior engineer's time managing manual compliance."
