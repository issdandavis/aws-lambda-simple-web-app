## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY (Attorney-Refined)

This provisional application describes a computer-implemented system for intent-aware governance in distributed autonomous AI agent networks. The system generates multi-dimensional context vectors encoding identity, intent (complex-valued), trajectory (coherence), timing (phase-lock), commitment (Merkle-proof), and signature (ML-DSA). Temporal trajectories are decomposed via Fast Fourier Transform to extract frequency-domain signatures. Phase-dependent interference patterns between agent intent vectors enable coordination detection. A six-gate verification pipeline applies harmonic scaling (H(d,R) = R^(1+d^2)) to produce security scores that increase super-exponentially with attack complexity. Post-quantum cryptographic operations are bound to intent-derived attributes, requiring spectral coherence thresholds for decryption. Security parameters adapt dynamically via entropic expansion (N(t) = N_0 e^(kt)) that increases computational work factor for anomalies. The system achieves sub-10ms per-gate latency with demonstrated 2182x improvement in attack resistance scoring versus conventional approaches. Applications include securing multi-agent autonomous systems, critical infrastructure, quantum-resistant access control, and distributed AI coordination where behavioral intent analysis is essential for security decisions.
