## SECTION 2: PATENT CORE COMPONENTS

### Executive Summary

SCBE-AETHERMOORE (Symphonic Cipher Behavioral Envelope - Adaptive Entropic Temporal Harmonic Emotional Response & Manifold Orchestration for Orchestrated Reactive Ecosystems) is a post-quantum cryptographic security envelope that integrates:

1. **Geometric Manifold Access Control**: 6D phi-weighted hyperbolic space with quasicrystal coordinates
2. **Six-Gate Verification Pipeline**: Context → Intent → Trajectory → AAD → Commit → Signature
3. **Harmonic Scaling**: H(d,R) = R^(1+d²) for super-exponential attack cost
4. **Complex Emotional Spin Vectors**: v(t) = A·e^(i(ωt+φ)) for intent encoding
5. **Spectral Decomposition**: FFT-based anomaly detection in frequency domain
6. **Entropic Expansion**: N(t) = N₀·e^(kt) creating "escape velocity" against Grover
7. **Swarm Coordination**: Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus with trust-weighted voting
8. **Triadic Temporal Manifold**: Three parallel time axes (linear, quadratic, gravitational)

### Independent Claim 1 (Broadened)

A computer-implemented method for adaptive intent-aware governance of distributed autonomous AI agents, comprising:

(a) receiving, by a processor, a context vector (c) from an AI agent, wherein the context vector comprises a multi-dimensional array encoding agent state including at least identity credentials, declared intent parameters, and behavioral trajectory data;

(b) computing a coherence score by applying spectral decomposition to the behavioral trajectory data to detect anomalous frequency components;

(c) determining a security profile by applying a harmonic scaling function H(d,R) = R^(1+d²) where d represents divergence from expected behavior and R is a geometric scaling constant;

(d) binding the context vector to cryptographic material using post-quantum key encapsulation (ML-KEM) and digital signature (ML-DSA) algorithms;

(e) evaluating intent compliance through a multi-gate verification pipeline comprising sequential validation of context assembly, intent trajectory, coherence metrics, additional authenticated data, commitment hash, and master signature;

(f) generating, upon successful verification, an authorization token permitting the AI agent to execute requested operations; and

(g) generating, upon verification failure, output indistinguishable from valid authorization to prevent information leakage to adversaries.

## SECTION 4: SUPPORTING MATERIALS

### Prior Art Differentiation

**Strongest Differentiators** (not found in prior art):

1. Spectral decomposition of emotional phase-modulated intent trajectories
2. Harmonic scaling H(d,R) = R^(1+d²) for governance work-factor
3. Entropic expansion causing attacker progress regression
4. Omni-directional swarm intent propagation with wave interference
5. Decimal drift detection via fractional state components
6. Triadic temporal manifold with gravitational dilation
7. Klein bottle topology for intent subspace orientation detection

**Prior Art Addressed**:

| Prior Art | How SCBE Differs |
|-----------|------------------|
| CA2316883C (Quasicrystal crypto) | SCBE uses quasicrystals for coordinates, not encryption |
| FFT emotion detection | SCBE applies to AI agents, not humans; uses for authorization |
| Hyperbolic embeddings | SCBE combines with Klein topology and triadic time |
| Swarm BFT protocols | SCBE adds emotional phase compliance and wave interference |

### Multi-AI Validation

3. **Demote metaphors** to embodiments in detailed description
4. **File provisional today** to lock priority date
5. **Non-provisional within 12 months** with real benchmarks and swarm demo
